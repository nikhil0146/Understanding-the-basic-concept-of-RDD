# What is Apache Spark?

Spark is a big data solution that has been proven to be easier and faster than Hadoop MapReduce. MapReduce were favorite but were slow. To overcome this issue, Spark offers a solution that is both fast and general-purpose. The main difference between Spark and MapReduce is that Spark runs computations in memory during the later on the hard disk. It allows high-speed access and data processing, reducing times from hours to minutes.

# What is PySpark?

PySpark is a tool created by Apache Spark Community for using Python with Spark. It allows working with RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) in Python. It also offers PySpark Shell to link Python APIs with Spark core to initiate Spark Context. Spark is the name engine to realize cluster computing, while PySpark is Pythonâ€™s library to use Spark.

# How Does Spark work?

Spark is based on computational engine, meaning it takes care of the scheduling, distributing and monitoring application. Each task is done across various worker machines called computing cluster. A computing cluster refers to the division of tasks. One machine performs one task, while the others contribute to the final output through a different task. In the end, all the tasks are aggregated to produce an output. The Spark admin gives a 360 overview of various Spark Jobs.
A significant feature of Spark is the vast amount of built-in library, including MLlib for machine learning. Spark is also designed to work with Hadoop clusters and can read the broad type of files, including Hive data, CSV, JSON, Casandra data among other.

# Why use Spark?

One of the main advantages of Spark is to build an architecture that encompasses data streaming management, seamlessly data queries, machine learning prediction and real-time access to various analysis.

Spark works closely with SQL language, i.e., structured data. It allows querying the data in real time.


Spark Context:
SparkContext is the internal engine that allows the connections with the clusters. If you want to run an operation, you need a SparkContext.
